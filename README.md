The purpose of this project is to analyze NBA player stats from regular seasons. 
It looks at things like field goals made (FGM), field goals attempted (FGA), and 3 point accuracy over time. The goal is to understand trends and 
relationships in player performance using stats and charts.
The class has some main parts. The data part stores all the player stats, while filtered_data keeps only the regular season data we need. 
Another part, player_data focuses on one players data, like the player who played the most seasons.
There are methods (functions) in the class that do different tasks. One loads the data, another filters it to show only the NBA regular seasons,
and others calculate things like average accuracy or make charts.
